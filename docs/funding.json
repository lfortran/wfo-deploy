It can execute user's code interactively to allow exploratory work (much like Python, MATLAB or Julia) as well as compile to binaries with the goal to run user's code on modern architectures such as multi-core CPUs and GPUs. It is currently in alpha stage.",

Currently in its alpha stage, the compiler can successfully compile seven third-party packages, details of which are available on our website. Our goal is to compile more packages to make the compiler robust and deliver a reliable beta version.",
