      <description>In our last blog post from May 2023, we announced that LFortran can compile legacy and modern Minpack. Today, we are happy to announce that LFortran can compile and run fastGPT.
This is the third code that LFortran can compile. The progress bar toward beta has progressed to 3/10.
LFortran is still alpha, meaning that users expect frequent bugs and breaking changes. Alpha users are enthusiastic partners in the effort to reach beta and they dilligently report issues.</description>
