      <description>&lt;p&gt;We received a lot of positive feedback on our LFortran &lt;a href=&#34;https://lfortran.org/blog/2019/04/why-we-created-lfortran/&#34;&gt;announcement&lt;/a&gt;. Most&#xA;generally like the idea and tool, and expressed interest to hear a bit more on&#xA;why we think Fortran is a superior language in its domain and why it makes&#xA;sense to use Fortran for new projects.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;why-fortran&#34;&gt;Why Fortran?&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Fortran was designed from the ground up to naturally and simply translate&#xA;mathematics to code that compiles and runs at maximum speed. And being&#xA;specifically targeted for such fundamentally computational tasks, it contains a&#xA;broad range of key functionality within the language itself, standard across&#xA;all platforms, with no need for external libraries that may or may not be well&#xA;optimized or maintained, at present or down the road.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
